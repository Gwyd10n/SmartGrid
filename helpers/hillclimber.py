# evaluate the initial state. If it is a good state then return and exit.
# keep looping until we get a solution or there are no new operaters left.
# when found select and apply new operators
# evaluate the new state if
# a) it is a goal state then quit
# b) it is better than the current state make it the new current state.
# if it is not better, go back to step 2
