# Heuristieken - Smart Grid
---
**Project**

Green energy is nowadays the energy of the future. Many houses receive their energy through solar panels, wind turbines or other installations. The problem here is that these installations often produce more than is necessary for their own consumption. It would be an economic advantage when the surplus could be sold back to the supplier. However, the infrastructure in this case (what we call the grid), is usually not designed for this particullar topic. To manage the overconsumptions and production, it is necessary to place batteries between the houses. Each of these batteries have a maximum capacity, whereby the houes have a maximum output.

The importance of this project is to see how the batteries can best be placed and how the costs can be reduced the most (based no the distances).
